# Assignment Repository

Welcome to the Assignment Repository! This repository contains assignments performed using Python on various datasets. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1
- **Objective:** Perform data manipulation operations using Python.
- **Tasks:** 
  - Read data from different formats (e.g., CSV, XLS).
  - Indexing and selecting data, sorting data.
  - Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column.
  - Count unique values of data, format of each column, converting variable data type.
  - Identifying missing values and filling in the missing values.

### Assignment 2
- **Objective:** Compute and display summary statistics for each feature in the dataset. Visualize the data using histograms.
- **Tasks:**
  - Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
  - Create histograms for each feature to illustrate the feature distributions.
  - Perform data cleaning, integration, transformation, and model building (e.g., Classification).

### Assignment 3
- **Objective:** Apply an appropriate machine learning algorithm on a dataset collected from a cosmetics shop to predict customer response for special offers.

### Assignment 4
- **Objective:** Perform k-mean clustering on a collection of 8 points. Answer specific questions related to clustering.
- **Tasks:**
  - Determine which cluster a given point belongs to.
  - Calculate the population of a cluster around a specific centroid.
  - Update the centroid values.

### Assignment 5
- **Objective:** Visualize data using Python by plotting various types of graphs.
- **Tasks:**
  - Use Scatter plot, bar plot, box plot, and histogram to visualize the data.

### Assignment 6
- **Objective:** Apply linear regression on temperature data to predict month-wise temperatures. Evaluate the performance of the regression model and visualize it.

### Assignment 7
- **Objective:** Build a machine learning model classifier using a Decision tree to predict whether a student will get admission to foreign universities based on their academic scores.
- **Tasks:**
  - Apply data preprocessing techniques.
  - Perform train-test split.
  - Apply a machine learning algorithm (Decision tree).
  - Evaluate the model.

Each assignment is accompanied by code and relevant explanations to understand the tasks performed.
